## Overview

Well i haven't learnt all of these yet but it is just a practice project to see the effect of transistion but, this is a very nice project and you will be pleased with this especially when viewing it on a desktop where all the effects will be seen. It is a responsive design which fit in all screen sizes.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See transistion effect for all interactive elements on the page.
